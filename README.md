# SQL Practice Repository

A collection of SQL practice problems focusing on fundamental database concepts and query techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains 11 SQL problems designed to reinforce core SQL skills including:

- **Basic Filtering**: SELECT statements with WHERE clauses
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN operations
- **Aggregation**: GROUP BY with COUNT, AVG, SUM functions
- **String Operations**: LENGTH and text manipulation
- **Mathematical Functions**: ROUND, MOD calculations
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements and NULL handling
- **Sorting**: ORDER BY with multiple criteria

## File Structure

Each SQL file follows a consistent format:
- Problem description with sample input/output
- Table schema definitions
- Expected results with explanations
- SQL solution

## Usage

Each file can be executed independently in any SQL database environment. The problems are designed to work with standard SQL syntax compatible with most database systems.

## Notes

- Some files contain syntax errors (trailing commas) that should be fixed before execution
- Solutions prioritize readability and correctness over performance optimization
- Problems are suitable for beginners to intermediate SQL practitioners
